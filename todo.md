# Development Chronology

Based on the current state of the codebase and what we've already implemented, here's the recommended chronology for completing the project:

## 1. Utils (Immediate Priority)
The utility modules are foundational and needed by all other components. They should be implemented first:

```
utils/
├── logger.py       # Logging system used by all components
├── config.py       # Configuration management
├── constants.py    # System-wide constants
├── helpers.py      # General utility functions
├── validation.py   # Input validation
├── exceptions.py   # Custom exception classes
└── decorators.py   # Reusable decorators
```

These utilities will be used throughout the codebase and should be implemented before moving on to other components.

## 2. Environment Setup (Immediate Priority)
Set up the environment configuration to ensure all components can access necessary credentials and settings:

```
.env.example        # Template for environment variables
requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
setup.py            # Package installation
```

## 3. Tests (High Priority)
Implement tests for the components we've already built to ensure they work correctly:

```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
│   ├── agents/     # Tests for agent implementations
│   ├── mcps/       # Tests for MCP clients
│   └── utils/      # Tests for utility functions
├── integration/    # Tests for component interactions
└── e2e/            # End-to-end workflow tests
```

## 4. APIs (High Priority)
Create API endpoints to expose the functionality:

```
apis/
├── research_api.py # Research workflow API
├── agent_api.py    # Individual agent APIs
└── auth.py         # Authentication for APIs
```

## 5. Examples (Medium Priority)
Implement example scripts to demonstrate usage:

```
examples/
├── research_example.py    # Complete research workflow example
├── agent_examples.py      # Examples of using individual agents
└── mcp_examples.py        # Examples of using MCP clients directly
```

## 6. Wagtail Integration (Medium Priority)
Integrate with Wagtail CMS if that's part of the project requirements:

```
wagtail_integration/
├── models.py       # Wagtail page models
├── views.py        # View handlers
├── templates/      # HTML templates
└── static/         # CSS, JS, images
```

## 7. Documentation (Ongoing)
Create comprehensive documentation for the project:

```
docs/
├── architecture.md     # System architecture overview
├── installation.md     # Installation instructions
├── configuration.md    # Configuration guide
├── usage.md            # Usage examples
├── api_reference.md    # API documentation
└── development.md      # Development guide
```

## 8. Containerization (Final Stage)
Set up Docker configuration for deployment:

```
Dockerfile          # Main application container
docker-compose.yml  # Multi-container setup
.dockerignore       # Files to exclude from Docker context
```

## Rationale for This Order:

1. **Utils First**: Utilities are used by all other components, so they need to be implemented first to provide a solid foundation.

2. **Environment Setup**: Proper environment configuration ensures that all components can access necessary credentials and settings.

3. **Tests Early**: Implementing tests early helps catch issues before they propagate through the system.

4. **APIs Before Wagtail**: The core API functionality should be implemented and tested before integrating with Wagtail, as it's more fundamental to the system's operation.

5. **Examples After Core Functionality**: Examples should be created after the core functionality is working to demonstrate real-world usage.

6. **Documentation Throughout**: Documentation should be created and updated throughout the development process, not just at the end.

7. **Containerization Last**: Docker setup should come last, after all components are working correctly.

This chronology ensures that we build the system in a logical order, with each step building on the previous ones. It also prioritizes the most critical components first, allowing for early testing and validation.
