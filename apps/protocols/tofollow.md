DID Registry
The implementation assumes a RESTful DID registry service. You have several options:

Centralized Registry: Implement a simple HTTP server that stores DIDs in a database
Decentralized Registry: Use IPFS, a blockchain, or a distributed hash table (DHT)
Web-based DIDs: Use the did:web method which stores DID documents at well-known URLs
For a complete implementation, you would need to:

Create a proper DID registry service
Implement proper DID resolution according to the W3C DID specification
Support multiple DID methods (did:key, did:web, etc.)
3. Cryptographic Implementation
The current implementation includes basic RSA signing and verification. For production use:

Support multiple cryptographic algorithms (Ed25519, secp256k1, etc.)
Properly implement JWK to PEM conversion
Add support for JWS (JSON Web Signatures) and JWE (JSON Web Encryption)
Implement proper key management (secure storage, rotation, etc.)
4. JSON-LD Processing
The implementation uses the pyld library for JSON-LD processing. For a complete solution:

Define proper JSON-LD contexts for your agent messages
Implement JSON-LD framing and compaction
Handle JSON-LD validation properly
5. Message Routing
For a complete implementation:

Support message forwarding through intermediaries
Implement proper error handling and retries
Add support for asynchronous messaging patterns
6. Security Considerations
For production use:

Implement proper authentication and authorization
Add rate limiting and DoS protection
Ensure proper validation of all inputs
Implement secure key storage
Add audit logging
7. Testing
The implementation should be thoroughly tested:

Unit tests for schema validation and cryptographic operations
Integration tests for the DID registry and messaging
Security tests to ensure proper validation and authentication
Conclusion
This implementation provides a comprehensive foundation for the Agent Network Protocol (ANP) as described in the specification. It includes:

DID Document Management: Creating, updating, and resolving DIDs
Cryptographic Operations: Key generation, signing, and verification
Secure Messaging: Creating and processing signed messages
Service Discovery: Finding agents by service type or properties
Server Implementation: Handling incoming messages via HTTP
The code is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing you to integrate it with existing systems and customize it for your specific needs. With the additional components mentioned above, you'll have a robust implementation of the ANP protocol ready for production use.

a2a.py

To fully implement and use the A2A protocol as designed, you'll need the following additional components:

1. Dependencies
Make sure to install these Python packages:

pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic httpx jsonschema sse-starlette

Copy

Execute

Authentication System

The current implementation includes placeholders for authentication:

The _validate_token method in A2AServer needs to be implemented with your actual authentication logic
You might want to integrate with an existing auth system (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
3. Task Handlers
The example implementation includes simple handlers for "echo" and "process_text" capabilities. In a real application:

Create a registry of capability handlers
Implement more sophisticated task processing logic
Add proper error handling and timeout mechanisms
4. Persistent Storage
For a production system, you might need:

Storage for agent cards (registry)
Logging of task executions
Caching of results for identical requests
5. Deployment Considerations
For production deployment:

Use a proper ASGI server like Uvicorn or Hypercorn behind a reverse proxy
Implement HTTPS for secure communication
Consider containerization for easier deployment
6. Testing
The implementation should be thoroughly tested:

Unit tests for schema validation
Integration tests for the client-server communication
Load tests to ensure it can handle the expected traffic
7. Monitoring and Observability
Add proper monitoring:

Structured logging
Performance metrics
Tracing for distributed systems
Conclusion
This implementation provides a complete foundation for the A2A protocol as described in the specification. It includes both client and server components, with proper schema validation, error handling, and rate limiting. The SSE-based streaming response mechanism allows for real-time updates during task execution.

The code is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add more capabilities and integrate with your existing systems. With the additional components mentioned above, you'll have a robust implementation of the A2A protocol ready for production use.

acp.py

To fully implement and use the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) as designed, you'll need the following additional components:

1. Dependencies
Make sure to install these Python packages:

pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic httpx aiofiles python-multipart

Copy

For the image handling examples, you'll also need:

pip install pillow

Copy

Execute

Storage Management
The implementation includes basic file storage for message parts, but for a production system:

Scalable Storage: Consider using object storage (S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) for attachments
Cleanup Policy: Implement TTL-based cleanup for stored messages
Compression: Add support for compressing large attachments
3. Authentication and Security
For production use:

API Key Validation: Implement proper API key validation in the server
HTTPS: Ensure all communication uses HTTPS
