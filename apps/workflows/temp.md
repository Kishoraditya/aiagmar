his completes the implementation of the Research Workflow. The workflow orchestrates the entire research process by coordinating multiple specialized agents:

Pre-response Agent: Clarifies the query and creates a research plan
Research Agent: Performs web searches and retrieves content
Summary Agent: Summarizes the research findings
Verification Agent: Verifies facts in the summary
Image Generation Agent: Creates visual aids for the research
File Manager Agent: Organizes and stores research materials
The workflow follows a structured process:

Query clarification and research planning
Creating a structured directory for research
Web search and content retrieval
Content summarization
Fact verification (optional)
Image generation (optional)
Saving research summary and materials
Generating final output in the requested format
The implementation includes:

Type definitions for structured data handling
MCP client initialization and management
Agent initialization and coordination
File and memory operations for persistent storage
Error handling and logging
Command-line interface for running the workflow
Interactive mode for conversational interaction
The workflow can be customized with various parameters:

Maximum number of sources to retrieve
Whether to include images
Whether to verify facts
Research depth (basic, standard, deep)
Output format (markdown, JSON, text)
This implementation provides a comprehensive solution for automated research, combining the capabilities of multiple specialized agents and MCP servers to deliver high-quality research results.
