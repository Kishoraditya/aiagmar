# Wagtail Integration

Based on the codebase context, there's no explicit mention of Wagtail integration yet. Here's how we could integrate with Wagtail:

1. Wagtail Models
Create models in wagtail_integration/models.py:

ResearchPage - Content type for research results
ResearchSettings - Site settings for research configuration
2. API Endpoints
Create API views in wagtail_integration/api.py:

ResearchRequestView - Handle research requests
ResearchStatusView - Check research status
ResearchResultsView - Get research results
3. Frontend Integration
Create templates and static files:

Research request form
Research results display
Progress indicators

API Exposure
To expose APIs for the research workflow, we could create:

REST API using FastAPI or Django REST Framework:

/api/research/request - Submit research requests
/api/research/status/{session_id} - Check research status
/api/research/results/{session_id} - Get research results
/api/research/cancel/{session_id} - Cancel research
WebSocket API for real-time updates:

/ws/research/{session_id} - Stream research progress updates
CLI Interface for command-line usage:

python -m apps.workflows.research_workflow "research query"
This plan provides a comprehensive approach to completing the system with well-structured utilities, examples, and integration points.
