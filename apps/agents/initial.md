    Based on the codebase context and the information in `apps/agents/initial.md`, I'll analyze which agent should be implemented first using LangChain and LangGraph frameworks.

## Analysis of Agent Dependencies

Looking at the agent descriptions in `initial.md`, I can identify the following dependency relationships:

1. **Manager Agent** coordinates the workflow and delegates tasks to other agents
2. **Pre-response Agent** interacts with users and presents plans from the Manager Agent
3. **Research Agent** performs web searches and fetches content
4. **Summary Agent** summarizes content fetched by the Research Agent
5. **Verification Agent** verifies facts found by the Research Agent
6. **Image Generation Agent** creates visuals based on research findings
7. **File Manager Agent** organizes and stores materials produced by other agents

## MCP Dependencies

The agents rely on these Model Context Protocol (MCP) services:

- **Memory MCP**: Used by Manager and Pre-response for state storage
- **Brave Search MCP**: Used by Research and Verification for web searches
- **Fetch MCP**: Used by Research for retrieving content
- **EverArt MCP**: Used by Image Generation for AI image creation
- **Filesystem MCP**: Used by File Manager for file operations

## Communication Protocol Considerations

The implemented communication protocols (A2A, ANP, ACP) will facilitate inter-agent communication, with:

- **A2A**: For direct agent-to-agent task handoffs
- **ANP**: For agent discovery and secure routing
- **ACP**: For multimodal messaging between agents

## Recommended Implementation Order

Based on the dependencies and workflow, here's the recommended chronological order for implementing the agents:

### 1. Manager Agent (First)

- **Rationale**: The Manager Agent is the orchestrator that coordinates all other agents. It's the central hub of the system and defines the overall workflow.
- **Dependencies**: Memory MCP
- **Framework**: LangGraph is ideal for the Manager Agent as it specializes in orchestrating complex workflows with state management.

### 2. Research Agent

- **Rationale**: Most other agents depend on the information gathered by the Research Agent, making it a critical early component.
- **Dependencies**: Brave Search MCP, Fetch MCP
- **Framework**: LangChain is suitable for implementing the search and retrieval functionality.

### 3. Summary Agent

- **Rationale**: Once research data is available, the Summary Agent can process it to create concise insights.
- **Dependencies**: Memory MCP (for storing summaries)
- **Framework**: LangChain's text processing capabilities are well-suited for summarization tasks.

### 4. Verification Agent

- **Rationale**: After research and summarization, verification ensures the accuracy of information.
- **Dependencies**: Brave Search MCP
- **Framework**: LangChain for implementing the verification logic.

### 5. Pre-response Agent

- **Rationale**: With research, summaries, and verification in place, the Pre-response Agent can now present coherent plans to users.
- **Dependencies**: Memory MCP
- **Framework**: LangChain for user interaction patterns.

### 6. Image Generation Agent

- **Rationale**: Visual content can be generated after the textual content is finalized.
- **Dependencies**: EverArt MCP
- **Framework**: LangChain for prompt engineering and image generation workflows.

### 7. File Manager Agent (Last)

- **Rationale**: The File Manager organizes the outputs from all other agents, so it logically comes last.
- **Dependencies**: Filesystem MCP
- **Framework**: LangChain for file operation patterns.

## Implementation Strategy

For each agent, I recommend:

1. **Define the agent's interface** using the appropriate communication protocol (A2A, ANP, or ACP)
2. **Implement the core functionality** using LangChain or LangGraph
3. **Connect to required MCPs** using the Python wrappers provided
4. **Integrate with the Manager Agent's workflow** in LangGraph

## First Implementation: Manager Agent

The Manager Agent should be implemented first using LangGraph, with:

1. A state machine defining the overall research workflow
2. Nodes representing each agent's functionality
3. Edges defining the flow of information between agents
4. Integration with Memory MCP for state persistence
5. Decision-making logic for routing tasks to appropriate agents

This will establish the foundation for the entire multi-agent system, allowing other agents to be plugged in as they're developed.
